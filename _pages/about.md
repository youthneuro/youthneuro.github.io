I'm Ryan!
======
I'm currently a student at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) majoring in neuroscience. I'm particularly interested in understanding childhood development through the lens of computational neuroscience. I've conducted research at the University of Chicago, Northern Illinois University, and UPenn. I'm open to the possibility of pursuing a minor in Healthcare Management at the Wharton School of Business, as I have some interests in consulting that focus on assisting medical systems. 

Current Focus
======
I'm currently working on two startups, and I'm also working on getting my Certified Nurse Assistant (CNA) certification over the summer. I'm also conducting deep brain stimulation and cognitive science research over the summer!
